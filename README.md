# MySnippets
I am going to use this repository to host any custom code that I want on my website, mysnippets.org. It will most likely consist of primarily css, and maybe a little html.

Here is the [link](https://jackrgilmore.github.io/MySnippets/bio_buttons.html) to the biology buttons embed. <br></br>
Here is the [link](https://jackrgilmore.github.io/MySnippets/alg_buttons.html) to the algebra buttons embed.
